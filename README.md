Front-end app in React that uses a movie database API to show top movies with multiple view options. Main view is full list with filter search by movie title. Second view is modal details view for individual movies.

API: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?api_key=b6fbc7f3f313bd395902af464ef47262&language=en-US&sort_by=popularity.desc&include_adult=false&include_video=false&page=1&with_watch_monetization_types=flatrate

Next steps:
- Create more filters for search bar (rating, vote average, genre)
